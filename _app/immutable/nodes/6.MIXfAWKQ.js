Wouldn’t you guys notice it easily?
Let’s get back to the conditional logic things. If you guys have no idea about it, in a nutshell, it’s likes a rules consist of If Statement, Else Statement, or Else If Statement. If any of that statement is true, or on-going, there’s another state called Action, or what to do. Eventhough it seems like a very simple rules, but in my opinion our brain was made from a collection of conditional logic.

It’s not as simple as when you are hungry, you go eat, some of us already programmed to have another option, like instead of reading their hungry feeling, they also have to check their money or food stock, if they don’t have food but they are hungry, they can’t eat, so they’ll just drink or do something else.
